Website themes
==============

Odoo offers numerous themes to shape your website's style and customize various options, including
colors, fonts, and layouts. When setting up your site using the Odoo website configurator, you are
prompted to select a theme that aligns with your desired aesthetic. If you wish to modify the theme
later, navigate to the website builder, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button, and access the
:guilabel:`Theme` tab. Diverse sections are at your disposal, allowing you to tailor different
aspects of your site to meet your requirements.

- :guilabel:`Colors`: The Website Builder relies on palettes composed of five colors. Two
  :guilabel:`Main` colors apply to your site's primary and secondary elements, and three
  :guilabel:`Light & Dark` colors apply to your site's lightish, withish, and blackish colors.

  You can also customize the :guilabel:`Color Presets` that have been defined automatically by the
  Website Builder according to the five previously defined color palettes. Click the arrow
  before a color preset to update it. Each color preset contains a color for your site's
  :guilabel:`Background`, :guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Headings`, :guilabel:`Links`,
  :guilabel:`Primary Buttons`, and :guilabel:`Secondary Buttons`.

  **To apply a color preset** to a building block of your site, select it, go to the
  :guilabel:`Customize` tab, click the :guilabel:`Background` button and select the one you want.
  If you modify later a color preset that have been applied to some elements of your site, they will
  all be updated automatically.

  :guilabel:`Add a Language`, select the :guilabel:`Page Layout`, and customize the

  website.

- :guilabel:`Input Fields`: An input field is a field where you can enter data or provide input,

  the :guilabel:`Show Header` button, inject :guilabel:`<head> and </body>` code, enter your
  Google map custom key, change the colors of the :guilabel:`Success`, :guilabel:`Info`,
  :guilabel:`Warning`, :guilabel:`Error` pop up messages by clicking the related
  :guilabel:`Status Colors` buttons, and customize the :guilabel:`Grays` elements of your site.
